BondBuilder: Chemical Boding AR app

It is an augmented reality mobile app that can recognize chemical bonding by combining markers.

Printable markers are uploaded but .apk file is currently not available, it will be released after paper[4] is published. 

Instead we uploaded the activity video using our app: m.site.naver.com/13f6L

This app was explained and applied in these academical papers:
