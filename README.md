BondBuilder: AR Chemical Bond

It is an augmented reality Android app that can recognize chemical bonding by arranging markers.

It is a mobile augmented reality application that can recognize chemical bonding by arranging markers, on which atoms are augmented, in the way of real chemical bonding. In order to make application useful in learning, application was designed by arranging markers, and markers were made circular to enable various combinations of angles. As a result, the total number of chemical bonding available in our application is 85, which includes most covalent and ionic bonding of high school curriculum of South Korea. The two-dimensional Bohr model and its three-dimensional structure are implemented. Not only covalent and ionic bonding are distinguishable in both models, but also bond and lone pairs are also distinguishable.
