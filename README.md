BondBuilder: AR Chemical Bond

It is an augmented reality app that can recognize chemical bonding by combining markers.

It is a mobile augmented reality application that can recognize chemical bonding by combining markers, on which atoms are augmented, in the way of real chemical bonding. In order to make application useful in learning, application was designed by marker combination, and markers were made circular to enable various combinations of angles. As a result, the total number of chemical bonding available in our application is 85, which includes most covalent and ionic bonding of middle and high school curriculum of South Korea. The two-dimensional Bohr model and its three-dimensional structure are implemented. Not only covalent and ionic bonding are distinguishable in both models, but also bond and lone pairs are also distinguishable. URL for downloading markers are as follow: https://github.com/jjimlmg/BondBuilder

Printable markers and .apk file are uploaded.

In order to publish this app in Play Store, we need 20 testers who can use our app and send feedback to us.

Please send email to jjimlmg@gmail.com who wants to be part of. We appreciate your participating in advance.

We uploaded the activity video using our app: m.site.naver.com/13f6L
