BondBuilder: AR Chemical Bond

It is an augmented reality app that can recognize chemical bonding by combining markers.

It is a mobile augmented reality application that can recognize chemical bonding by combining markers, on which atoms are augmented, in the way of real chemical bonding. In order to make application useful in learning, application was designed by marker combination, and markers were made circular to enable various combinations of angles. As a result, the total number of chemical bonding available in our application is 84, which includes most covalent and ionic bonding of high school curriculum of South Korea. The two-dimensional Bohr model and its three-dimensional structure are implemented. Not only covalent and ionic bonding are distinguishable in both models, but also bond and lone pairs are also distinguishable.

Printable markers and .apk file are uploaded.

In order to share this app freely in Google Play Store for global public access, we need at least 20 testers who can send us the feedback of using our app.

If you want to join our project by sharing your valuable experience to enhance our app, please let us know. (creativeye@snu.ac.kr)
